SP Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their SP branded products. Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period. Sales director Narayan wanted this immediately but the analytics manager is engaged on another critical project. Sales director Narayan decided to give this work to Sukhdev who is the curious data analyst of SP Mart. These insights will be directly reported to the sales director.
